        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am definitely a bit of a techno geek. Modern technology - and science - is so amazing. Bordering on being magical. Almost mystical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building things was an early passion. Problem solving an acquired skill. I found myself learning, and working, in electronics and eventually getting into computers. Learned to work on them from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building and repairing computers, and networks, became a passion. But learning to program became my jam. I always enjoyed seeing things I created work and/or put to use. Creating apps and web pages allowed instant gratification in seeing them work.

          But I still have not acquired either a t-shirt or cap emblazoned with my motto, Rather Be Coding. Eventually maybe. Meanwhile, I have projects to work on, gardening to do, and possibly automating more of my life, and house, along with possibly incorporating crafts and electronics.
